    <h3>Why ALT School?</h3>
    <p>
      As an undergraduate, I became quite interested in technology due to the vast oppurtunities it presents.
      From the streamless ease of doing business across the continent from the tips of your fingernails to providing solutions about daily needs, I wanted to expand my knowledge. <br>
      I have been studying programming for a few months before i applied for ALT school. My major challenge was consistency and being part of a team that could help me grow at a much faster pace. <br>
      ALT school provides this in addition to great instructors hence my excitement to join ALT school.
      I believe ALT school will help to improve my skills by participating in real-life projects, assignments and assessments to test my skills.
      All these and more are convinving factors that made me apply to ALT school.
